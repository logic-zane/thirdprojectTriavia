# Project 3 - *Trivia App*

Submitted by: **Jinlong Zhang**

The Trivia App is a simple quiz application that tests users' knowledge across multiple categories. It displays one question at a time, showing the category, question prompt, and four answer choices. Users select an answer by tapping a button, and the app checks if the answer is correct, updating the score accordingly. The app tracks the userâ€™s score and displays the final score in an alert after the last question.

It shows the current question number and category to indicate progress. After completing the quiz, users can restart the game, which resets the score and displays the first question again. The app features a clean and intuitive interface with labels for the question, answers, category, and question number. It includes console logs for debugging and uses a scalable data model for easy question management. The Trivia App is a user-friendly and interactive way to test knowledge with clear feedback and easy navigation.
